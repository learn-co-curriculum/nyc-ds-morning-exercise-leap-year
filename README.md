# Leap year function

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

- The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
- The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
- The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Can you figure out how to write a function that determines if a year is a leap year?
